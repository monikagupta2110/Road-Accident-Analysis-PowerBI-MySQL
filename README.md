## Project Overview
This project analyzes road accident data to identify high-risk patterns based on time, weather, road type, and accident severity.

## Tools Used
- Power BI
- MySQL
- SQL
- Excel

## Data Preparation
- Cleaned and transformed raw data using MySQL
- Handled duplicates, missing values, and category standardization
- Created derived columns (Year, Month, Time Slot)

## Dashboard Highlights
- Total accidents and casualties
- Accident trends over time
- Accidents by road type, weather, and severity
- High-risk districts analysis

## Key Insights
- Single-lane roads record the highest accidents
- Peak accidents occur during morning and evening rush hours
- Clear weather still shows high accident frequency

## Note
MySQL was used for data cleaning and transformation. Final analysis and visualization were performed in Power BI.
